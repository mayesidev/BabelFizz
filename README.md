# BabelFizz

A project to implement a solution for FizzBuzz in different programming languages.

## FizzBuzz Description

Print out sequential numbers from 1 to n, except when the number is divisible by-

* 3, then print "Fizz" instead.
* 5, then print "Buzz" instead.
* Both 3 and 5, then print "Fizz Buzz" instead.

See [expected-output.txt](.\expected-output.txt) for an example where n=100.
